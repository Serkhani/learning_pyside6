* ### Introduction

***[PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)*** Tutorial is designed for beginners and intermediate ***[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)*** developers who want to learn how to create cross-platform GUI applications using ***[PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)***. The tutorials provide step-by-step explanations, code examples, and projects to help you understand and apply the concepts effectively.

* ### Installation
Before starting the tutorials, you need to have ***[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)*** installed on your system. You can download the latest version of ***[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)*** from the official ***[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)*** website.  
-   - ### Installing ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)***
      The tutorials are provided as ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)*** files.To install ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)***, follow these steps:
      - Open a terminal or command prompt.
      -  Run the following command to install ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)*** using pip:
            ``` bash
            pip install jupyter  
            ```
        
    For more detailed instructions on installing ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)***, refer to the official Jupyter documentation.

* ### Usage
    - Clone the repo
        ``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/Serkhani/learning_pyside6
        ```
    - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the ***[Learning PySide6](https://github.com/Serkhani/learning_pyside6)*** repository  
        ``` bash
        cd learning_pyside6
        ```
    - Start ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)*** by running the following command:
        ``` bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    ***This will open [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) in your default web browser.***
    - Open the *.ipynb files to access the tutorials.

* ### Tutorials  

The tutorials are organized into days and weeks to guide your learning journey progressively. Each week covers specific topics, and each day focuses on a particular aspect of ***[PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)***. You'll find ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)*** files for each tutorial, which contain explanations, code snippets, and links to relevant YouTube videos.

Each tutorial provides a structured approach to learning ***[PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)***, starting from the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. The ***[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)*** files allow you to interact with the code examples directly and experiment with different concepts. Still in working process though ðŸ˜…
