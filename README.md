* ### Introduction

[PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) Tutorial is designed for beginners and intermediate [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) developers who want to learn how to create cross-platform GUI applications using [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/). The tutorials provide step-by-step explanations, code examples, and projects to help you understand and apply the concepts effectively.

* ### Installation
Before starting the tutorials, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) installed on your system. You can download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) from the official [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) website.

* ### Installing [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
The tutorials are provided as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files, which allow you to interact with the code examples and run them in an interactive environment. To install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) using pip:
Copy code
pip install jupyter
Once the installation is complete, you can start [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) by running the following command:
Copy code
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
This will open [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in your default web browser. You can now navigate to the directory where you downloaded the [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) Tutorial repository and open the .ipynb files to access the tutorials.
For more detailed instructions on installing [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), refer to the official Jupyter documentation.

* ### Tutorials
The tutorials are organized into days and weeks to guide your learning journey progressively. Each week covers specific topics, and each day focuses on a particular aspect of [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/). You'll find [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files for each tutorial, which contain explanations, code snippets, and links to relevant YouTube videos.

Week 1:

Day 1: Introduction to [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/)
Day 2: Creating Windows and Widgets
Day 3: Layout Management
Day 4: Signals and Slots
Day 5: Advanced Widgets
Week 2:

Day 1: Working with Menus and Actions
Day 2: Event Handling
Day 3: Dialogs and Message Boxes
Day 4: Custom Widgets
Day 5: File Handling and Serialization
Each tutorial provides a structured approach to learning [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/), starting from the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced topics. The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files allow you to interact with the code examples directly and experiment with different concepts.
