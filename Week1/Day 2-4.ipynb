    "Day 3: Basic PySide6 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "PySide6 is a Python binding for the Qt framework, which allows you to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for your applications. In this tutorial, we will explore some basic features of PySide6 and learn how to create a simple GUI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Installing PySide6\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) if needed.\n",
    "Open the command line or terminal and run the following command to install PySide6 using pip:\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "pip install PySide6\n",
    "Step 2: Creating a Basic PySide6 Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new Python file in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the necessary PySide6 modules by adding the following lines at the beginning of your file:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QLabel\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "Create a new class that inherits from the QMainWindow class. This will be the main window of your application. Add the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class MyApplication(QMainWindow):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.setWindowTitle(\"My First PySide6 Application\")\n",
    "        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 400, 200)\n",
    "        self.label = QLabel(\"Hello, PySide6!\", self)\n",
    "        self.label.move(150, 80)\n",
    "This code sets the window title, size, and creates a QLabel widget with a text message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside the class, add the following code to create the application instance and run the main event loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n",
    "    window = MyApplication()\n",
    "    window.show()\n",
    "    sys.exit(app.exec())\n",
    "This code creates an instance of the QApplication class, initializes the main window, shows it, and starts the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file with a .py extension, such as my_first_app.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the command line or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "python my_first_app.py\n",
    "This will launch your PySide6 application, displaying the main window with the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Day 4: My First Application (Introducing Basic OOP Concepts)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the tutorial, we will introduce some basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and enhance our PySide6 application by adding functionality to a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Adding a Button to the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the QPushButton module by adding the following line to your file's import statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QLabel, QPushButton\n",
    "Inside the MyApplication class, modify the __init__ method to add a button below the label:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "class MyApplication(QMainWindow):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.setWindowTitle(\"My First PySide6 Application\")\n",
    "        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 400, 200)\n",
    "        self.label = QLabel(\"Hello, PySide6!\", self)\n",
    "        self.label.move(150, 80)\n",
    "        self.button = QPushButton(\"Click Me\", self)\n",
    "        self.button.move(150, 120)\n",
    "Save the changes and run your application again. You should see a button added below the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Handling Button Clicks\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following method to the MyApplication class, which will handle the button clicks:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def button_clicked(self):\n",
    "    self.label.setText(\"Button Clicked!\")\n",
    "Modify the __init__ method to connect the button's clicked signal to the button_clicked method:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "self.button.clicked.connect(self.button_clicked)\n",
    "Save the changes and run your application. Clicking the button should now update the label text to \"Button Clicked!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have learned some basic PySide6 features and created your first application. Additionally, you were introduced to fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming by extending the functionality of the application. You can continue building upon this knowledge and explore more advanced PySide6 features to create even more sophisticated GUI applications."
